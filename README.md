# my.simple - Simplifying, Expediting Microservices & Kubernetes Development
**Stateless/Stateful, Active/Active, Active/Passive, Security, High Availability, Horizontal Scaling, API, Kubernetes, Microservices.** All those big words usually popup during planning of a distributed application... 
**The problem starts during implementation!** 

Over-engineering, Over-complexity & trying to re-use & push past, bloated, code of a single process application into a container is an **epic scale pandemic**, 
causing companies and the industry to spend trillions of $, re-inventing a **complex, money pit & unmaintainable "wheels"** that should have been simple...

### So let's do that properly & Make It Simple... ### 
Join in this step-by-step journey of building an example application using **my.simple** infra. There is a lot... Will cover the **"What?s"** and deep dive to **my.simple "How?s"**, that will save you a huge amount of effort, time & money and allow you to concentrate on what really matters... **Your business.**  

## Example Applications ##
There are two nerratives we need to cover, stateless application & statefull applications. 
Will develop both, following the thumb rules for each one and how its challenges are solved within **my.simple**. 

### We will start with basic, very common, Infra
* [String conversions & concatenation](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/strng)
* [Logs & Logging](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/logs)
* [Blocking Sync Queues](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/queues)
* [Sync Maps](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/maps)
* [Struct Type Registry](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/registry)
* [Security](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/security)

### We will continue with
* Protobuf Actions & Types
* Microservices Secure Networking
* Stateles Services

### Pluggable Data Stores & ORM
* Pluggable ORM & Data storing

### Stateful Services
* Leader/Follower elections
* Cache Sync
* Stateful distributed Transactions

### Maintainability
* Automation & Regression Testing
