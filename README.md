# Fullstack software building blocks for better work/life & business balance
## Overview
In a nutshell, **Software Development** is being treated & manage as any other industry out there.
However, some of the very basic management & work/life practices, alongside though to be true paradoxes, are simply not true for **Software Development**.
Via **Coherent Analysis**, **Design Decomposition** & **Out-of-the-Box** thinking, Software Development, done right, can solve paradoxes and extremely better work/life balance.

# Simple Is A State Of Mind, my.simple is proving that...
Deep dive into my.simple [story](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/blob/main/docs) or continue on to the components & building blocks.

. @TODO - Add a link to an example project using my.simple here that does <Employee Database Module>

## So let's Make It Simple... 

.

## Basic Building Blocks
The basic building blocks are a must-have for any application. 
They implement the most basic design patterns used inside any microservice and expedite development.
* [String conversions & concatenation](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/strng)
* [Logs & Logging](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/logs)
* [Blocking Sync Queues](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/queues)
* [Sync Maps](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/maps)
* [Struct Type Registry](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/registry)
And
* [Security](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/security)

## Process 2 Process Secure Networking
One of the biggest challenges of MicroServices, one that usually pose the biggest pain point, "Troubles"/Challenges is the Process 2 Process communication.
In other words, "How will my MicroServices **Communicate, Interact & Share data** with each other?"
A single mistake in this area will crete a very big headache, pose challenges that should not have been there, worsen dramatically the engineers work/life balance and will cause the company Hundreds of Millions of dollars in maintenance.
**[my.simple Secure Networking](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/net)** is giving a seamless & simple, secure communication between your MicroServices.

## Introspection & Deep Cloning
The process of deep analysis & cloning a tree/graph models at runtime without having the model at compile time is called [Introspection](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/introspect).
The is extremely usable in agnostic handling of **Delta Notifications**, **ORM (Object Relation Mapping)** &**Generic Distributed Cache**.

## Protocol buffers & Services
* [Protobuf Object](https://github.com/saichler/my.simple/tree/main/go/utils/protobuf_object)
* Protobuf Service Points

### Pluggable Data Stores & ORM

* Pluggable ORM & Data storing

### Stateful Services

* Leader/Follower elections
* Cache Sync
* Stateful distributed Transactions

### Maintainability

* Automation & Regression Testing

## Example Applications ##

There are two nerratives we need to cover, stateless application & statefull applications.
Will develop both, following the thumb rules for each one and how its challenges are solved within **my.simple**.

Join in this step-by-step journey of building an example application using **my.simple** infra. There is a lot... Will
cover the **"What?s"** and deep dive to **my.simple "How?s"**, that will save you a huge amount of effort, time & money
and allow you to concentrate on what really matters... **Your business.**
