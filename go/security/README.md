# Security
## Overview
Security is handled by the [Security Provider](https://github.com/saichler/my.security), and it is meant to be implemented as a plugin that is dynamically loaded.

## The ShallowSecurityProvider
The **ShallowSecurityProvider** is for **testing purposes** only and does not contain any meaningful implementation. **That implementation is in a private repository, for securitty purposes...:o)**
