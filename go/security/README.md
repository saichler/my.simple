# Security
## Overview
Security, with AAA is abstracted & interfaced by the [Security Provider](https://github.com/saichler/my.security). 

The **full-blown, Enterprise** security implementation, 
including a plugin that contains a **Secure Storage** & **eBFP** methods is implemented in a private repository, for security reasons...:o) 

## The ShallowSecurityProvider
The **ShallowSecurityProvider** is for **testing purposes** only and does not contain any meaningful implementation.
